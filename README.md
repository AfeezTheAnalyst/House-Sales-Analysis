## Introduction
The focus of this project is to analyze the house sales of the King County area in Washinbgton DC. The dataset I used was extracted from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andykrause/kingcountysales).

By combining historical data with current information during the cleaning and preparation process, it becomes possible to accurately pinpoint changes like renovations, demolitions, and new constructions.
